After three years in advertising/strategy, I decided to embark on a new coding journey. During my coding gap year, I completed half of the core curriculum at [42 Berlin](https://42berlin.de) and the 3-months full-stack web development bootcamp at [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com/berlin/web-development-course). Have a look at my work!
